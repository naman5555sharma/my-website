Namo-namah, I'm currently a final year MS(By Research) student in IIT Bombay's [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). I am working under the guidance of [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) focusing on the performance aspects of microarchitecture, particularly data prefetching and cache management, as part of our [research group](https://casper-iitb.github.io/).  

I graduated with a B.Tech in Information Technology from the Engineering College, Ajmer, in June 2022.

If I am not working on my computer, you can find me playing cricket. Reach out to me!
