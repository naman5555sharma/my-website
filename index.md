Namaskar, I'm currently a first year PhD. student in IIT Bombay's [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). I am working with [Prof. Biswa](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) Panda on Computer Architecture and Hardware Security.

I graduated with Btech in Electronics and Communication from MAIT, Delhi in June 2021. After that I worked as a RTL design engineer at [Incore Semicounductors](https://incoresemi.com/) for about one and a half year, some quick mentions of the area I worked on while working there are RISCV based core, hypervisor, TLBs, Pagetable walk etc.

If I am not working on my computer, you can find me playing football. Most of my past work is open-source, thanks to my organization and collaborators. I love collaborating on open-source projects. Reach out to me!
